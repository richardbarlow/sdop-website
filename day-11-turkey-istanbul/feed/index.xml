		<description><![CDATA[Hi Greg, mum here, we have arrived safely at Silvias.  11 hours is a long time to sit on a plane though, Nick had really had enough by the end of it!  Love reading the posts with your adventures and looking at the photos, what an amazing time you are all having.  

About to take Silvias dogs for a walk and Nick is looking forward to shopping in the mall with Alexandra.  Our Alex is still sleeping off the jet lag, it is now 8 in the morning of our first day, I&#039;ve been awake properly since about 2am, but am feeling fine.  

Well, love you lots and am thinking of you all,  Fingers crossed for your gear box.  Hopefully be able to speak on or around my birthday sometime, but don&#039;t worry if its not possible.  I am watching your progress all the time. 

Lots and lots of love, Mum xxxxxx]]></description>
