		<description><![CDATA[What a week! Don&#039;t know when you&#039;ll be back on here but here&#039;s a little something to help you on your way through the desert. You&#039;ll have to work on the syllable to note ratios! Feel free to add more verses ad nauseam.

GO EAST

(Together) We went on our way
(Together) On a Saturday
(Together) Mongolia is our aim
(Together) We must be insane

(Together) We will eat and sleep
(Together) Beware of those mountain sheep
(Together) We will drive so far
(Together) Drink in the world’s best bar

(Go East) To Ulaanbaatar
(Go East) Seven lads, that’s who we are
(Go East) In our ambulances
(Go East) With no extravagances

(Go East, this is what we&#039;re gonna do, Go East)

(Together) Blogging as we go along
(Together) Singing this cheery song
(Together) We will see the sites
(Together) And hope we don’t get the sh*tes

(Together) in Ad-ven-tu-re
(Together) and En-dea-vo-ur
(Together) we’ll have 10k on the clock
(Together) plus a re-machined engine block

(Go Help) is the charity
(Go Help) bringing prosperity
(Go Help) in Asia from coast to coast
(Go Help) to those who need it most

(Together) We Go East not West
(Together) There’s no need for a vest
(Together) With dodgy language skills
(Together) We keep taking the pills

(Together) Matt, Greg, Rich (known as Pauly D)
(Together) Ian, Alex, Neil not forgetting Berry
(Together) Young, free &amp; living the dream
(Together) We’re the SDOP team

(Go East) To Ulaanbaatar
(Go East) Seven lads, that’s who we are
(Go East) In our ambulances
(Go East) With no extravagances

(Go East, this is what we&#039;re gonna do, Go East)]]></description>
